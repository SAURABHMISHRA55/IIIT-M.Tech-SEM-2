# IIIT Hyderabad - M.Tech-CSE (Spring 2024) 🌸

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to the Spring 2024 semester at IIIT Hyderabad! This repository is a collection of my work and contributions throughout this semester, covering the fascinating subjects I took. Each folder represents a different subject, filled with assignments, projects, and research that showcase the learning journey we've been on.

## What's Inside? 📚

### 1: Statistical Methods in Artificial Intelligence 🤖
This course was the highlight of my semester, offering hands-on experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Image Processing, Neural Networks, and more. The folder contains four assignments, with the fourth being a mini project:
- **Assignment 1, 2, 3:** Focused on foundational AI and ML techniques.
- **Assignment 4 (Mini Project):** This was a Kaggle competition where I participated and applied advanced AI concepts to solve a problem. This project integrates knowledge across various domains and provides a practical experience of AI in action.

### 2: Independent Study - Hate Speech Detection Using Machine Learning 🧠
This independent study focused on enhancing hate speech detection on social media using cutting-edge machine learning models. The repository is organized as follows:
- **`code/`**: Jupyter notebooks implementing individual and integrated models, including BERT, CNN, LSTM, and their combinations.
- **`review/`**: Summaries of key texts and peer reviews that informed the study.
- **`merger_papers/`**: PDFs of research papers that inspired model integrations.
- **Research Paper**: A detailed research paper (under review) summarizing the study’s methodologies and findings will be added upon publication.

### 3: Information Security and Audit Assurance 🔐
This course expanded my knowledge beyond my usual areas, focusing on security practices and audit assurance. The folder is divided into five sections:
- **Election Commission of India Simulation Exercise**
- **FELICITY RISK ASSESSMENT**
- **ISO 27001**
- **Public Cloud Client Assurance**
- **SECURITY AUDIT FIREWALL**

Each folder contains detailed reports and exercises related to security audits, risk assessments, and compliance standards.

### 4: System and Network Security 🛡️
This course provided deep insights into system and network security. Although I cannot upload the professor’s slides, I’ve included one of the key tasks:
- **Research Paper**: An original paper written after analyzing a latest research paper from an A* journal. It includes references to other significant papers and suggests innovations based on the analysis.

## Wrapping Up 🎉

This semester has been an incredible journey, packed with learning and exploration across different areas of Computer Science. I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in these subjects. Here’s to another successful chapter in our M.Tech-CSE journey at IIIT Hyderabad!
